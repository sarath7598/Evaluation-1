## Mismatch prediction based on customer reviews and ratings



Customers' reviews and ratings are helping businesses improve their services and products these days, but some reviews are mismatched to their star rating, affecting the overall rating of the product or service. For example, there are times whenever a user writes Good, Nice, or any other positive text in a review and gives a 1-star rating.

The goal of this research is to do sentiment analysis and develop a model that can predict positive and negative messages. I also want to create an app that can be used to track down customers who leave nice reviews but have a low rating, and then create a developer response for them. There is a discrepancy between the star rating and the reviews.

## Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.
## Vectorization
Word Embeddings or Word vectorization is a methodology in NLP to map words or phrases from vocabulary to a corresponding vector of real numbers which used to find word predictions, word similarities/semantics. The process of converting words into numbers are called Vectorization.
## Modelling
I utilized logistic regression for modeling, and it gave me a 79 percent accuracy.
 ## Flask App
 I saved the final tuned logistic regression model and deployed it using Flask web app. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
